1. Age Vector

```{r}
age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
length(age)
```
a. Data points
b.R code output

2. Reciprocal Age
```{r}
age <-c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,
35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,
51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
reciprocalage <- 1/age
print(reciprocalage)
```
3. Assign new age
```{r}
age <-c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
newage <-c (age, 0, age)
print (newage)
```
4. Sort Values
```{r}
age <-c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41,51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
sort_age <- sort(age)
print(sort_age)
```
5. Find Minimum and Maximum
```{r}
age <-c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29,35, 31, 27, 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 42, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24, 33, 41.)
minage <-(age)
maxage <-(age)
print(minage)
print(maxage)
```
6. 2nd Data set
```{r}
data <-c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
length(data)
```
7. Doubled data
```{r}
data <- c(2.4, 2.8, 2.1, 2.5, 2.4, 2.2, 2.5,
2.3, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7)
datadoubled <-  data_*2
print(datadoubled)
```
8. Sequence

```
+8.2
```{r}
seq(20:60)
```
+8.3
```{r}
mean(20:60)
```
8.4
```{r}
sum(51:91)
```
8.5
```{r}
