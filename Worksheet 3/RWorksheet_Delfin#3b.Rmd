```{r}
#1. Create a data frame using the table below.
#a.
library(dplyr)
Respondents <- c(seq(1,20))
Sex <- c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2)

#b
#The dataset consists of responses from 20 individuals, providing details about their gender, with 7 males and 13 females. It also includes information about their fathers' occupations (coded as 1, 2, or 3), household sizes (ranging from 3 to 11 people), school-going siblings (ranging from 1 to 6), and the type of houses they reside in (coded as 1, 2, or 3). Conducting further analysis on these variables can uncover valuable insights.

#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
                Doubles=double(),Characters=character(),
                Logicals=logical(),
                Factors=factor(),
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))

#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv
